<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<h2>Single-Purpose Statement</h2>
<p>
  The sole purpose of this extension is to help users download and manage all images on Ycut case detail pages with a single click, streamlining the manual, one-by-one image download process.
</p>

<h2>Reason for “downloads” Permission</h2>
<p>
  To automatically download the selected image files into a user-specified local folder, avoiding the need for users to right-click and “Save as” each image individually.
</p>

<h2>Reason for “downloads.open” Permission</h2>
<p>
  To automatically open the download folder once all images have finished downloading, allowing users to immediately view their downloaded files and improving convenience.
</p>

<h2>Reason for “scripting” Permission</h2>
<p>
  To inject and execute content scripts that dynamically insert a “Download All Images” button into the case detail page, capture image URLs, and kick off the download workflow.
</p>

<h2>Reason for “storage” Permission</h2>
<p>
  To save user preferences—such as the name of the last-used folder and other simple settings—so they can be automatically applied on subsequent uses, providing a smoother experience.
</p>

<h2>Reason for Remote Code Usage</h2>
<p>
  This extension does <strong>not</strong> load or execute any remote code; all logic runs entirely on the user’s local machine.
</p>

<h2>Reason for Site Access Permission</h2>
<p>
  Access is granted only to the single domain  
  <code>https://is.ycut.com.tw/is/case/detail/*</code>  
  for the purpose of retrieving image URLs and triggering downloads on that page; no other sites are accessed or their data collected.
